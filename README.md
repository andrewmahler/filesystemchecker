This is an implementation of a file system checker that I created in my operating systems class. It takes in a file system image and reads the super block in order to understand more about the size of the file system and other vital information. After this, the file system runs a series of checks to verify the integrty of the file system. Some of the tests include making sure that each folder has a pointer to the parent directory as well as itself. This program required extensive knowledge of this type of file system, because as folders need to make room for more files/folders, the layout of the folder changes, as pointers begin to point to not files/folders themselves, but to more blocks of memory where these file/folder pointers are held
